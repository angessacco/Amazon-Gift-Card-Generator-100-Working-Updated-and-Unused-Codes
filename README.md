**Why Are Amazon Gift Cards So Popular?**

Amazon is a global retail giant, offering everything under one virtual roof. Gift cards provide the flexibility to buy whatever you want without the constraints of choosing a specific product. They’re especially popular during the holiday season, birthdays, and other special occasions.

**The Myth of Amazon Gift Card Generators**
